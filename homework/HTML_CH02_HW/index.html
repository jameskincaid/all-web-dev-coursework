<h2>Music</h2>
<p>
   <h4> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Music has always been a hobby of mine but has progressively grown into a lifestyle in recent years. I thrive for every aspect of music whether it is playing guitar, writing lyrics, recording, performing, etc. Lately, my activities have been reduced to playing guitar and writing lyrics. I have been in a few bands but I usually stick to writing alone. Music, in my honest opinion, should be fueled by emotion and passion and not just digital sound effects. Lyrics are poetry in the same way a rough draft is a blank canvas. Music is art and exactly why it will always be my favorite hobby.</h4>
